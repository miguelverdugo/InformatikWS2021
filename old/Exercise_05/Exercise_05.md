# Exercise sheet 5 - Python Basics

---

> _Your preparation of exercises should include two aspects:_
>
> _(1) Try to present exercises in a way that everyone can follow (even if that
> person didnâ€™t do the exercise at all), so please explain all the (vital) parts of
> your solution in a slow and comprehensive way._
>
> _(2) Try to also include some background information where applicable, and/or
> explain the possible context/motivation for the given exercise._

1. Start a `python` shell and type

    ```python
    import this
    ```
   Explain what you are doing and the result.

2. There are a few ways to run `python` code, e.g.
   - `python` shell
   - `ipython`
   -  scripts
   - `jupyter` notebooks

   Explain some of the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. In which cases you should use
   each of them?

3. Create a `jupyter` notebook and use it to explain the most important `python` data types
(e.g. `str`, `int`, `float`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, etc)

   - How do you determine the type of a variable?

4.  Write a `python` script that takes 3 numbers as command line arguments, adds them up and prints
    the result. Access to the command line arguments is provided by the module `sys`, where `sys.argv[n]` represents the argument at the `n` position.

5.  Write as simple python script that takes a number that represents a distance in pc as an input and then returns the equivilant distance as lightyears and kilometers. Try to format the output in a scientific notation.

6.  Packages extend the functionality of `python`. A great repositories of packages is PyPI
    (https://pypi.org/). Search for a package (of your preferred topic), install it and run a simple demo,
    preferentially in your favorite IDE (`spyder`, `pycharm`, etc). Most of the packages have links to
    their documentations where you can find some minimal examples to run.
