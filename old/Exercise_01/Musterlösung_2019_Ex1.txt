1. u.cloud: cloud service of University
   u.access: service of the library
   u.space: gernal administrative tasks

2. Four basic rules of the unix philosophy:
    1. Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather
      than complicate old programs by adding new "features".
    2. Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet
       unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid
       stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive
       input.
    3. Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early,
       ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and
       rebuild them.
    4. Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task,
       even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of
       them out after you've finished using them.

3. sudo apt get install [something]

4. physical: everything you can touch, i.e. routers and such
   logical: the elements of the connection based on SW, i.e. adresses
   www: global collection of resources that are identified using URIs

5: IPv4: 32-bit adress
   IPv6: 128-bits, larger adressing capability

6. cd ,ls, mkdir, mv, cp
