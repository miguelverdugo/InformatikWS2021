1. calc2.sh

2. Acceptors: checks if input is a given state and passes to next state depending on outcome (accepted or rejected)
   Classifiers: subcategory of acceptors
   Transducers: returns output based on the input. (e.g. traffic light: if green then switch to red )

3. tl.sh

4. compiled: entire programm is converted into machine code (compiled)
   interpreted: executes instructions line by line

5. protects access to python objects (multiple threads can't execute python
   bytecodes at once), necessary since memory management isn't thread-safe.
   hinders multithreading leading to perfromance bottlenecks.
