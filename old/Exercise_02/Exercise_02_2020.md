1. Start a (Linux) terminal/shell.

    * Practice navigation in the directory structure: Opening of directories,
      listing of directory content, going one level up again.

    * Create a directory and create a new file within it. Use an editor to
      write some content in that file, rename the file and copy it to another location.

2. An important characteristic of Linux is the strict handling of (user)permissions.
   Enter `ls -l` and explain the output. How can file/directory permissions (`rwx`),
   and user/group membership (of files/directories) be changed?

3. What are processes under Linux? How can you get a good overview over currently
running processes (in a Linux terminal)? What do the most important parts of
the output of `top` or `htop` mean?

    - How do you terminate a program in Linux?

4. Redirect the output of the command `ls` to a file. What is the difference of
an output redirection with `>` compared to one with `>>`?

    * Try to come up with a reasonable use-case of the input redirection (`<`) and explain it

5. What does the pipe `|` do? Please explain it with few examples.
