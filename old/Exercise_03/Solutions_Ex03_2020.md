  The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

  Beautiful is better than ugly.
  Explicit is better than implicit.
  Simple is better than complex.
  Complex is better than complicated.
  Flat is better than nested.
  Sparse is better than dense.
  Readability counts.
  Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
  Although practicality beats purity.
  Errors should never pass silently.
  Unless explicitly silenced.
  In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
  There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
  Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
  Now is better than never.
  Although never is often better than *right* now.
  If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
  Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

which describes the phylosophy of ``python``. 


Modules are set of routines that extend the basic functionality of python

2. 
  - ``python`` shell will always run, but its functionality is limited. Useful only to do very little things
  - ``ipython`` is a shell aimed for interactiviy, it improves the basic functionality of the ``python`` shell with things like autocompletion, help and additional non-python commands. It can be used for more advaced stuff. 
  - ``scripts`` are aimed to run in their own without using the shells, there is no limit what ``scripts`` can do, from very small calculations to full-flegded programs.
  - ``jupyter`` notebooks extend the ``ipython`` system with a graphic interface integrated in the browser. Besides code, it can incorporate graphics, and text descriptions. Excellent for sharing results. Main drawback is that individual cells can be executed out of order, producing sometimes weird results.
  
3. So that students can get accustomed to the notebook environmetn. Important here are the distinction between ``tuples`` (inmutable) and ``list`` mutable. Dictionaries are also important as the elements can be accessed with via keywords

  - type of the variable is determined with the function ``type()``


5. A float uses 24 bytes in python, while a float requires only 4 bytes in memory (32-bits). The difference is due to the need to represent the float as a datatype (actually a class) with additional attributes and methods attached to it.
