1. Start a `python` shell and type

    ```python
    import this
    ```
   Explain what you are doing and the result. 


2. There are a few ways to run `python` code, e.g.
   - `python` shell
   - `ipython`
   -  scripts
   - `jupyter` notebooks

   Explain some of the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. In which cases you should use each of them?

3. Create a `jupyter` notebook and use it to explain the most important `python` data types
(e.g. `str`, `int`, `float`, `list`, `dict`, `tuple`, etc)

   - How do you determine the type of a variable?

4.  Write a `python` script that takes 3 numbers as command line arguments, adds them up and prints
    the result. Access to the command line arguments is provided by the module `sys`, where `sys.argv[n]` represents the argument at the `n` position.

5. The function ``sys.getsizeof(object)`` returns the size (in bytes) of a ``python`` object in memory. According to that function, How much memory a _float_ uses **in** ``python``? Please explain the difference with respect to the the system requirements.
