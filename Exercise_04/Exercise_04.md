1.  In moodle you can find a `python` script called `portscanner.py`
    which scans the ports of a host to find out if any of them are
    open. Execute it, providing `localhost` as a input. How many ports
    are open?

    -   Now open a session of `jupyter notebook` and execute the script
        again. Do you see a difference?
    -   In a separate terminal execute: `python -m http.server` and
        execute the script again.

    What is happening?

2.  Use the command `traceroute` to a website of your preference. Describe the
    output of that command. Use the IP address listed in the output to find out the
    "physical" route that the packages followed using a geolocation service
    (e.g. [ipinfo.io](ipinfo.io)).

3.  Use `ssh` to connect a server to `login.univie.ac.at` or any other server

    - Use `scp/sftp` to download/upload files

    - What `ssh/scp/sftp` stands for? Why?

4.  Look in `PyPi` for a `python` package that can perform (text)
    encryption. Install it in your system and encrypt (and decrypt) the
    text generated by `import this`{.python}

    - After seeing the results, what is encryption useful for?

    - Using the function to calculate the entropy from the previous exercise,
    evaluate the _entropy_ before and _after_ the encryption
